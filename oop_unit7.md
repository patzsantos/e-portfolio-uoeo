# Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Gain an understanding of the need to debug code and the typical types of errors which can be found in a program.<br>
-Examine the ability of linters to support the development of high quality code.<br>
-Become familiar with a range of data structures which may be used to store data.<br>
-Explore the effectiveness of different search techniques to examine the stored data.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:<br>**_
_-Apply Python tools to examine the quality of code.<br>
-Implement data structures to store data.<br>
-Implement a search algorithm to explore stored data.br>_-->

## e-Portfolio Activity

[Create](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%207/datastructures.py) a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods: items(), keys(), values()

## Summative Assessment 1

[System Design of a Driverless Car](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Driverless%20Car%20Summative%20Assessment%201%20and%202/System%20Design%20Proposal/OOP%20Assignment%201_%20A%20Design%20Proposal%20of%20Software%20to%20Support%20Operation%20of%20a%20Driverless%20Car.pdf)

## Reflection

I truly enjoyed making UML diagrams for this unit. I had to watch videos about its development process to better understand what they are used for, and what they intend to show, depending on the model. As a result, even though it was quite overwhelming, creating various UML models for my driverless car enlightened me as to what operations I will include in the proposal. This would not have been possible without academic reading and research about autonomous vehicles. Data structures will be useful in storing data for my driverless car, such as dictionary for traffic lights and queue for objects to avoid.
