# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Examine the operations which may be applied to sets, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.<br>
-Gain an appreciation of the linear data search technique.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Describe the scenarios in which each of the set operations will be applicable in relation to the driverless car scenario.<br>
-Implement a linear data search technique.<br>_-->

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: OO Design for IoT**

Making reference to the article by Fortino et al. (2015), consider the strengths and weaknesses of designing a metamodel to support object-oriented design of the IoT. [Design](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/OOP%20Unit%208_%20Collaborative%20Discussion-%20OO%20Design%20for%20IoT.pdf) a smart model equivalent to that presented in Figure 6 which would instead support operation of a driverless car.

## Codio Activities

Polymorphism: 
- [Method overloading 1](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overloading.py)
- [Method overloading 2](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overloading2.py)
- [Method overriding](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overrriding.py)

## Reflection

The collaborative discussion introduced me to designing metamodels that support IoT design. After reding more on it, I have discovered it still has weaknesses, despite its numerous strengths. Though there is still room for improvement, the design activity gave me a chance to improve on my driverless car class diagram into a smart model one. The result was a more specific and clearer diagram, that incorporated hardwares used, as well as color blocking to better distinguish classes.
