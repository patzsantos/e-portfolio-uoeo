# Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Define the type and functions of a typical Operating System. <br>
- Give examples of common operating systems.<br>
- Explain the differences between processes, threads and schedulers.<br>
- Describe key approaches to make OSes more secure.<br>
- Discuss the difference between virtualisation approaches.<br>
- Advise on the differences between dynamic and shared libraries.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Describe mitigations to make operating systems more secure.<br>
- Explain some of the key risks and vulnerabilities associated with operating systems.<br>
- Outline the differences between static and dynamic libraries and when to use each.<br>

## Independent Work

<details><summary><h3>Equivalence Testing in Python </h3></summary><br>  

The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.

## Reflection
The assigned reading for this unit mostly covered Cyclomatic Complexity testing. There seems to be a mixed view on it, with some authors citing that they are unnecessary, while some saying that they are still valid in designing code today. In the same way, for the team discussion about Cyclomatic Complexity, there was no consensus within the team as well. We had divided opinions about it. You can see my opinion, as well as that of my team members, in the Cyclomatic Complexity individual portfolio component and team discussion in the sections above. <Br>

The lecturecast for the week is about Testing. I learned about the reasons for testing, and what steps to take in order to implement it. It is important to test code early in the Software Development Life Cycle in order to avoid wasting time and resources. MITRE listed down software weaknesses to watch out for developing software such as user session errors, bad coding principles, processing errors, amongst others. OWASP also provides developers testing principles and techniques to write better and more secure code.<br>

There are many testing methods and designs to follow. Therefore, it is important for developers to fully understand what and who their software is intended for, so that they can implement the correct testing methods throughout its creation. At the same time, I think that knowing what to ask when planning tests and familiarising myself with testing standards, testing techniques, testing tools, and automated testing in Python, will help me towards the coding exericises in the next units, as well as that of the individual project. <br>
