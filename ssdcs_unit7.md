# Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Define the type and functions of a typical Operating System. <br>
- Give examples of common operating systems.<br>
- Explain the differences between processes, threads and schedulers.<br>
- Describe key approaches to make OSes more secure.<br>
- Discuss the difference between virtualisation approaches.<br>
- Advise on the differences between dynamic and shared libraries.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Describe mitigations to make operating systems more secure.<br>
- Explain some of the key risks and vulnerabilities associated with operating systems.<br>
- Outline the differences between static and dynamic libraries and when to use each.<br>
<br>

## Independent Work

<details><summary><h3>e-Portfolio Component: What is an Ontology?</h3></summary><br>  
What do you understand about the ontology that has been presented for your reading this week? Could you attempt to define an ontology that would be relevant to the system that you are designing for the summative assessment?

<details><summary><h3>Activity 1: Exploring a Simple Python Shell</h3></summary><br>  
In this session, you will create a command shell in Python, and then run it and answer questions about it. You can use your chosen Jupyter Notebook space for your work.<br>

Review the blogs at Praka (2018) and Szabo (n.d.) and then create a CLI/ shell that implements the following:<br>

- When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory
- The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result
- The HELP command provides a list of commands available
- The EXIT command exits the shell
- Add suitable comments to your code and add the program to your e-portfolio. Be prepared to demonstrate it in the seminar session next week.<Br>

<!--Run the shell you have created, try a few commands and then answer the questions below. Be prepared to discuss your answers in the seminar.

What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?
What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?
Add a section to your e-portfolio that provides a (pseudo)code example of changes you would make to the shell to improve its security.
Remember to also record your results, ideas and team discussions in your e-portfolio.-->

<details><summary><h3>Activity 2: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h3></summary><br>  
In this session, you will create a RESTful API which can be used to create and delete user records. Responses to the questions should be recorded in your e-portfolio.<br>

Using the Jupyter Notebook workspace, create a file named api.py and copy the following code into it (a copy is provided for upload to Codio/GitHub): You can install Jupyter Notebook on your local machine following these instructions or via the University of Essex Software Hub.<Br>
