# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

<!--_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

_-Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.<br>
-Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram._<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:<br>**_

_-Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.<br>
-Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviours and interactions within a system._<Br>-->

## Formative Activities

Continue the discussion in unit 1. Based on what we have covered in the first two units, you should [respond](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%202/OOP_%20Unit%202%20Peer%20Responses.pdf) to at least 2 of your peersâ€™ contributions from Unit 1. <br>
