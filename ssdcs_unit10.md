# Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Explore the evolution of system architectures, from distributed systems to microservices.<br>
- Examine the strengths and weaknesses of the variety of approaches to distributed systems.<br>
- Define the security attacks which are specific to virtual environments.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_

- Describe a variety of distributed systems, and the pattern in which they evolved.<br>
- Discuss the security attacks that distributed systems, in particular, are vulnerable to.<br>
- Understand the ways in which virtual systems need to be protected due to the specific nature of attacks on them.<br>

## Independent Work

Read Schmitz et al (2016) article about faceted data.

Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?
Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python.
