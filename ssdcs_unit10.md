# Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Explore the evolution of system architectures, from distributed systems to microservices.<br>
- Examine the strengths and weaknesses of the variety of approaches to distributed systems.<br>
- Define the security attacks which are specific to virtual environments.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_

- Describe a variety of distributed systems, and the pattern in which they evolved.<br>
- Discuss the security attacks that distributed systems, in particular, are vulnerable to.<br>
- Understand the ways in which virtual systems need to be protected due to the specific nature of attacks on them.<br>
<br>

## Independent Work

<details><summary><h3>e-Portfolio Component: Faceted Data</h3></summary><br>  

Read Schmitz et al (2016) article about faceted data.

Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?
Create a basic outline design of how you would create such a system in Python.

<details><summary><h3>Unit 10 Seminar: API Demonstrations</h3></summary><br>  

In this session, we will review your teamâ€™s progress for the final submission in Unit 11 by carrying out demonstrations of your code. Expand the API created in Unit 7 with functionality relevant to your summative code submission.

You are also welcome to demo your summative code assessment in Week 10 if you are complete by then, but the session is arranged for Week 11 to give you the maximum time available. The demonstrations in this seminar are for the API seminar work, without the assumption that your summative assessment development is complete by then.

Read the paper: S. Fiore et al. (2019) (in your reading list for this week). Making reference to page 117659 and the paragraph which begins, "Through an API or via web pages, ...", write a similar paragraph which is applicable for the system that you have designed and developed.".

## Reflection

In unit 10, I wrote a summary post to wrap up the TrueCrypt cryptography case study summary post. All of my peers and I concluded that TrueCrypt is not safe anymore, hence, it is recommended to search for other alternative encryption tools such as BestCrypt and BitLocker. 

I also read about faceted data for the Independent work this week. I learned that faceted data increases security by classifying what type of information each user can see, depending on their security clearance. The part wherein we had to create a basic outline design of how to create such a system in Python was a little difficult to me. I am not sure if what I did was correct, but I still tried it, based on the reading from Schmitz et al. (2016:19)

I attended the seminar entitled 'API demonsrations' where we discussed the e-portfolio and seminar activities. It was a good chance for us to get a better understanding of how to go about our coding output and API demonstration.
