# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_ <br>
_-Apply unit tests to test the functionality of Python code.<br>
-Use the pylint testing tool to automatically check acceptability of the style used to write the Python code.<br>
-Experiment with approaches to commenting inline and documenting code.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_ <br>
_-Write unit tests to ensure correct functionality of Python code.<br>
-Run pylint against a Python script to demonstrate stylistic correctness.<br>
-Document code for release to stakeholders.<br>_-->

## Formative Activity
Continue the discussion in unit 8. You should now provide a [summary post](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/OOP%20Unit%2010_%20Summary%20Post.pdf) into to the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers.

## Seminar Content Activities
1. [Commenting and documentation](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/calculation.py) - added appropriate comments and documentation in the code.<br>
2. [Unittest](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/calculation_test.py)- tested the operations of the previous activity (Commenting and documentation) through unittest
