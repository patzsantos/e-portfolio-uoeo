# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Experiment with further UML models, including a class diagram.<br>
-Write a Python program which implements the UML class diagram.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Prepare a class diagram which corresponds to a system which will be implemented.<br>
-Take a UML model and implement software using it._-->

## Codio Activity
- [Double day](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%204/codio_doubleday.py)

## Reflection

I took advantage of this week to get back on track with answering my Codio exercises. Learning about class diagrams was a bit overwhelming for me. But my understanding is that they detail quite well how to implement systems. This will be very helpful in developing the proposal of my driverless car. However, I have to admit that I need to do more reading and research on class diagrams.
