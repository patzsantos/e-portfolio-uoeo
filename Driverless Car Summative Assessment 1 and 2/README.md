# 7D Driverless Car System
Welcome to the 7D Driverless Car System! This is a system implementation of code designed to support the operation of a driverless car based on [this](link) system design proposal. During the development process, it has been decided that driverless car will be named **7D Driverless Car System**, or **7D**

### Car Operations
7D can only start running if an authorized user starts it. That user also has the capability to stop the car. After an authorized user starts the driverless car, it can then function autonomously. 

The three main operations of 7D are: 

1.) Car Control- covers the main movement of the car. 
The car can steer, accelerate, and brake. 

2.) Environment Perception- uses GPS and Light 




### Purpose
This is the first and second Summative Assessment requirement for the Object-Oriented Programming module offered by University of Essex Online.

The first summative assessment was a Driverless Car Design Proposal was represented by UML models and incorporated usage of data structures. The system design can be found [here](link)

The second part of the assessment, which is [System Impelementation](link), requires code implementation of the design proposal.
