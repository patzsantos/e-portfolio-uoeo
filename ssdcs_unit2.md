# Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

-Gain an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC.<br>
-Experiment with the creation of UML flow charts.<br>
-Understand the range of ways in which software security can be problematic.<br>
<br>
_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
-Research the academic literature on software development which follows an agile process and prioritises security.<br>
-Break down the steps involved in a process so that they may be represented as a flow chart.<br>
-Reading areas of an ISO/IEC Standard on security and becoming familiar with the language and concepts.<br>
<br>

<br>
Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.<Br>
  
Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.<br>

## Collaboration

<br>
We had to start getting in touch with our teammates for the design document development team project. Our team started a group chat where we discussed what to include our contract, and decide on our team name--Bulwark.

## Criticality 
<br>

### Reflection
<br>
This week, I started the last module for my PG Cert Computer Science Course in University of Essex Online, Secure Software Development (Computer Science). I am both excited and nervous. Excited because software security really interests me, for I know that they are crucial in developing systems and programs that are safe from malicious and persistent attacks. Therefore, specialisation in Secure Software Development is greatly sought after nowadays. 
<br>

The Lecturecast entitled 'Introduction to Software Development' introduced me to the agile, waterfall, and spiral approach to software development. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and it is good to analyse the scale of your team and project in order to choose the appropriate approach. I also gained familiarity with international bodies that set security standards or IT systems such as 'World Wide Web Consortium', 'The Internet Society', 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology', and 'The International Organisaion for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission'. There was also a review about creating UML Diagrams, which was tackled in the previous module. 
<br>

I attended the first seminar, 'Introduction to Team Project', which acquainted me with the tutor, expectations for the next 12 weeks, and the major requirements for the module. Right after the seminar, I reached out to my team mates for the development team project due on the 6th week. I think we started off on the right foot. We had just a few days to create our team contract, but we were able to come to a consensus as to how to write it. Therefore, I look forward to our group work synergy over the next 6 weeks. 
<br>

In addition, I was able to read about the the Top 10 Web Application Security Risks and Top 10 Proactive Porotocols identified by the 'Open Web Application Security Project' to prepare me for my initial post for the collaborative discussion. This activity enabled me to choose one coding weakness, and present using UML where the risk may arise. The UML design activity from the OOP module definitely helped in my selection of the activity diagram modelling and syntax use. I am aware that I still need more practice on how to better prsesent and use syntax when creating UML models, but I really enjoy creating them as they make program and software development processes clearer for me to understand.</details>
