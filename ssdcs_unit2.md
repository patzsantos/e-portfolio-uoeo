# Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Gain an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC.<br>
- Experiment with the creation of UML flow charts.<br>
- Understand the range of ways in which software security can be problematic.<br>
  
_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Research the academic literature on software development which follows an agile process and prioritises security.<br>
- Break down the steps involved in a process so that they may be represented as a flow chart.<br>
- Reading areas of an ISO/IEC Standard on security and becoming familiar with the language and concepts.<br>
<br>

<br>
Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.<Br>
  
Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.<br>

## Collaboration

<details><summary><h3>Collaborative Discussion 1: UML flowchart Peer Response</h3></summary>
<br>
Continue the discussion in unit 1 . You should choose at least two of your peers' contributions and comment on the weakness they chose, as well as:<br>

- What do you like about their flowchart?<br>
- In what way(s) might it be improved?<Br>

Your posts should be a maximum of 300 words. Please include sufficient content so that others may be encouraged to reflect on and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as “Peer Response”. You should do this before working through the preparation for the Seminar this week.

## Reflection

We had our second seminar this week entitled Scrum Security Review. I learned about the software development stages during the Scrum Agile Approach to project management. We further discussed which UMLs can be best presented in a flowchart, and the examples given gave me an idea as to how to better explain processes through activity and swimlane diagrams. <br>

Right after the seminar, my team had our kick-off meeting. It was nice to align our goals, and have a preview of how we will tackle our project over the next 5 weeks. I am honestly a little overwhelmed with this project, but more so with the individual coding part. But I am happy with how the team has been communicating well these past two weeks, and we seem to have the same goals in mind.<br>

The e-Portfolio activity, which is a blog post on managing people in cybersecurity, was a good opportunity to get acquainted with the language and concepts set down in the ISO/IEC Standard on security. I applied my learning from Unit 1 about the OWASP Top 10 Protocols 2018 into my selection of the ISO/IEC terms for the blog post, which aims to deal with managing people in cyber security within organisations. <br>
