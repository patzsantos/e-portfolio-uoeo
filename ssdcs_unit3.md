<br>
Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?
You should read Chapter 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio.<br>
<br>
- What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?<br>
- Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.<br>
- Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.<br>
<br>
Team component
You should discuss your answers within your team, and you can share your team responses with the tutor for formative feedback or discuss it in next weekâ€™s seminar.

## Criticality 
<br>

### Reflection

<br>
We wrapped up the first discussion forum from units 1-3 this week. To summarise my learning, I can say that it is especially helpful for future software developers like me to get acquainted with the OWASP Top 10 in order to have an idea of cyber threats and which protocols to are accepted to fight against them. The feedback from my tutor and peer helped me revise my UML activity diagram for the better.
<br>
Team Bulwark, the software development team I am a part of, also had our second meeting this week. We discussed the document outline, as well as the reading we have to do in order to make headway in our project. Lastly, we discussed about the e-portfolio team activity compotent, wherein we have to discuss what constitutes a secure programming language. <br>
