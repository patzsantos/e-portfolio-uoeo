## Formative Activities 

Continue the discussion in unit 1. You should now provide a [summary post](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203-%20Summary%20Post.pdf) into to the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. 

## e-Portfolio Activities

- [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20UML%20Models%20Applicable%20at%20Different%20Stages%20of%20the%20SDLC.pdf) which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to [design](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20Washing%20Machine%20State%20Diagram.pdf) a similar model for a washing machine.
