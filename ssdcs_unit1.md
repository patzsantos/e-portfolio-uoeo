# Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development #


<!--_**In this unit we shall:**<br>_ 
Explore the waterfall and agile approaches to software development, with a focus on the implications of developing secure software using each.
Become acquainted with the Unified Modelling Language and how it can be used to support software development.
Gain a familiarity with the standards which are used by industry to develop secure software.
Appreciate the importance of developing a risk-aware culture within an organisation.

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**<br>_
Identify relevant academic literature which discusses the ways in which secure software may be developed using an agile process.
Decompose an activity into a set of tasks which can be represented using a flow chart from the UML portfolio of modelling techniques.
Describe the importance of creating a culture of risk awareness in an organisation, in addition to the creation of secure software.**<br>_-->


## e-Portfolio Activities

1. Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP_%20Unit%201%20Review%20the%20article%20by%20Di%20Silvestro%20%26%20Nadir%20(2021).%20Discuss%20one%20aspect%20of%20this%20article%20which%20you%20find%20unexpected..pdf) one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.

2. [Develop](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/protected_unprotected.py) a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability**

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP-%20Unit%201%20Initial%20Post.pdf) for the priorities assigned.

## Codio Activities

Classes and Objects: 
- [Circle](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/codio_circle.py)
- [Persons list](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/codio_persons.list.py)<br>

## Reflection 
I will admit that I have no prior exposure or grasp of Object Oriented programming. Therefore, a lot of the concepts and terms are alien to me. The collaborative discussion about factors that influence reusability was a good introduction to this module, as it gave me an overview of how that practice can lead to efficacy in producing new software, as not everything has to start from scratch. Codio activities, it seems, are becoming more complex for me.
