# Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development 
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Explore the waterfall and agile approaches to software development, with a focus on the implications of developing secure software using each.<br>
- Become acquainted with the Unified Modelling Language and how it can be used to support software development.<br>
- Gain a familiarity with the standards which are used by industry to develop secure software.<br>
- Appreciate the importance of developing a risk-aware culture within an organisation.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Identify relevant academic literature which discusses the ways in which secure software may be developed using an agile process.<br>
- Decompose an activity into a set of tasks which can be represented using a flow chart from the UML portfolio of modelling techniques.<br>
- Describe the importance of creating a culture of risk awareness in an organisation, in addition to the creation of secure software.**
<br>

## Independent Work

<details><summary><h3>Collaborative Discussion 1 Initial Post: UML Flowchart</h3></summary>
<br>
Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?

## Collaboration

<details><summary><h3>Team Contract</h3></summary>
<br>
We had to start getting in touch with our teammates for the design document development team project. Our team started a group chat where we discussed what to include our contract, and decide on our team name--Bulwark.

## Criticality 
<br>

### Reflection
<br>
This week, I started the last module for my PG Cert Computer Science Course in University of Essex Online, Secure Software Development (Computer Science). I am both excited and nervous. Excited because software security really interests me, for I know that they are crucial in developing systems and programs that are safe from malicious and persistent attacks. Therefore, specialisation in Secure Software Development is greatly sought after nowadays. 
<br>

The Lecturecast entitled 'Introduction to Software Development' introduced me to the agile, waterfall, and spiral approach to software development. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and it is good to analyse the scale of your team and project in order to choose the appropriate approach. I also gained familiarity with international bodies that set security standards or IT systems such as 'World Wide Web Consortium', 'The Internet Society', 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology', and 'The International Organisaion for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission'. There was also a review about creating UML Diagrams, which was tackled in the previous module. 
<br>

I attended the first seminar, 'Introduction to Team Project', which acquainted me with the tutor, expectations for the next 12 weeks, and the major requirements for the module. Right after the seminar, I reached out to my team mates for the development team project due on the 6th week. I think we started off on the right foot. We had just a few days to create our team contract, but we were able to come to a consensus as to how to write it. Therefore, I look forward to our group work synergy over the next 6 weeks. 
<br>

In addition, I was able to read about the the Top 10 Web Application Security Risks and Top 10 Proactive Porotocols identified by the 'Open Web Application Security Project' to prepare me for my initial post for the collaborative discussion. This activity enabled me to choose one coding weakness, and present using UML where the risk may arise. The UML design activity from the OOP module definitely helped in my selection of the activity diagram modelling and syntax use. I am aware that I still need more practice on how to better prsesent and use syntax when creating UML models, but I really enjoy creating them as they make program and software development processes clearer for me to understand.

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability**

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP-%20Unit%201%20Initial%20Post.pdf) for the priorities assigned.
