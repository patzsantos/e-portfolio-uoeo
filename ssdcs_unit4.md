# Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Explore the use of regular expressions and recursion in creating software solutions.<Br>
- Investigate the effects of using regular expressions and recursion on system security.<br>
- Recommend the most suitable approaches for given security requirements/ risk appetites.<br>
<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Explain how and when to use regular expressions in solutions. <br>
- Describe how and when to use recursion in solutions. <br>
- Discuss the security implications of both approaches.<br>
<br>

## Independent Work

<details><summary><h3>Portfolio Component: Programming Language Concepts </h3></summary><br>  

Read Larson (2018) and Weidman (n.d.) then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio. You may want to complete this activity in conjunction with or after completing Seminar 2 preparation.<br>
<br>
- What is ReDOS and what part do ‘Evil Regex’ play?<br>
- What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated?<br>
- How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?<br>

<details><summary><h3>Seminar Activity: Recursion</h3></summary><br>  
<br>
One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. A good explanation and walkthrough are provided by Cormen & Balkcom (n.d.) - the link is in the reading list. (the code they used for their visual example is provided on their website as well).<br>
<br>
Read the explanation, study the code and then create your own version using Python (if you want to make it more interesting you can use asterisks to represent the disks). Create a version that asks for the number of disks and then executes the moves, and then finally displays the number of moves executed.<br>

## Criticality 
<br>

### Reflection

<br>
I was a bit late with watching the seminar from last week, 'Programming Languages'. I caught up on that this week, which was timely since it was covered in the 3rd seminar, 'Programming Language Concepts'. Honestly, there was too much new information for me. It was good to see some concepts learned during the OOP module reviewed during the lecturecast and seminar. I learned that there are 4 traditionally accepted core paradigms of programming. These are Imperative, Functional, Logical, and Object Oriented.<br>
<br>
Our team design project is progressing well. I believe that we are on the right track, and hopefully, we can finalise everything before the internal deadline we set for ourselves, which is April 19th. We met earlier in the week, towards the end of unit 3, but I thiink that counts as our meeting for unit 4. The meeting lasted 2 hours since we had to go over the document draft that we had so far, and assign the remaining unfinished parts. We decided to consult our tutor as well, which has been very helpful. She advised on how to improve the structure and contents of the document, as well as answered the queries of the team regarding the next phase of the project which involves coding.<br>
