# Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Review the history and concepts of programming languages.<br>
- Investigate language concepts using Python as an example.<br>
- Describe best practices and methods to overcome common security issues.<br>
<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Describe some key milestones in the development of programming languages.<br>
- Outline some of the key paradigms that define the different types of languages.<br>
- Explain the key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.<br>
- Discuss key programming challenges and recommended best practices.<br>
- Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.<br>
<br>

## Independent Work

In this example, you will compile and run a program in C using the Jupyter notebook workspace provided (Buffer Overflow in C). The program is already provided as bufoverflow.c - a simple program that creates a buffer and then asks you for a name, and prints it back out to the screen.

Now carry out a comparison of this code with one in Python (Buffer Overflow in Python), following these instructions:<br>
<br>
In your workspace, you will be using the file called Overflow.py. You are able to download the zip file 'buffer-overflow-in-python' along with additional instructions in the PDF 'Exploring Python Tools and Features'.

Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?
You should read Chapter 2,6,7,8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio.<br>
<br>
Team component:<br>
You should discuss your answers within your team, and you can share your team responses with the tutor for formative feedback or discuss it in next weekâ€™s seminar.<br>

## Criticality 
<br>

### Reflection

<br>
We wrapped up the first discussion forum from units 1-3 this week. To summarise my learning, I can say that it is especially helpful for future software developers like me to get acquainted with the OWASP Top 10 in order to have an idea of cyber threats and which protocols to are accepted to fight against them. The feedback from my tutor and peer helped me revise my UML activity diagram for the better.<br>
<br>
Team Bulwark also held its second meeting this week. We discussed the document outline, as well as the reading we have to do in order to make headway in our project. Lastly, we discussed about the e-portfolio team activity compotent, wherein we have to define what constitutes a secure programming language. Over the week, we worked on our Team Activity and Design Document. On the last day of the unit, we went over our Design Document together. We discussed how we can improve on it, and decided to consult with our tutor within the week so that she can give us feedback. <br>
<br>
I had a chance to work on the individual activity, where I learned that the function fgets() is more secure than just gets(), as it prevents overloading and gives the developer the freedom to select the buffer size. It was my first time working on a .c file, so I ran the first part of the activity on jdoodle.com. As usual, discuss.python.org was a big help in fixing what was causing my problem with the installation of pylint. I'm happy that I was finally able to figure out how to run this widely-used linting tool on my python files, which I did for the first time for the second part of the individual activity.
