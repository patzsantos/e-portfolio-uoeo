# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Gain an appreciation of the fact that Python does not use pointers, while other programming languages, such as C, do.<br>
-Understand that the way in which code is design can contribute a carbon footprint and consider the design and development of code to minimise this footprint.<br>
-Recognise that code may be organised in a variety of manners dependent on the way in which components will interact with one another.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>
_-Describe the overhead incurred in some programming languages other than Java as a result of their use of pointers.<br>
-Discuss the reasons why Python is a more sustainable programming language than others.<br>
-Experiment with the design of code using a variety of design patterns.<br>_-->

## Summative Assessment 2:

## Reflection

So far, this has been the most difficult activity and assessment for me. During the seminar, my peer and tutor found many syntax errors in my code. I had to put in extra time and work in order to improve it. It was a good thing that I started the assessment quite early.  After many trials and errors, I feel that I was able to execute most of my design proposal. It is definitely not an excellent program, but I know that I did my best, and I am quite happy with my submission. Moreover, when I was stuck, I am thankful that members in discuss.python.org explained to me in great detail how I can make my code function the way I wanted it to.
