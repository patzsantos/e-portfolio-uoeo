# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_

_-Examine the factory design pattern and consider how it may be implemented in software.<br>
-Consider the fact that multiple design patterns may be applied alongside one another in a single code development.<br>
-Recognise that some design patterns are more likely to be used with others in a single code development.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<Br>
_-Write a Python program which applies a factory design pattern to generate objects.<br>
-Discuss the fact that multiple design patterns are able to be applied together to support a single code development.<br>
-Describe the design patterns which are more likely to be applied with one another in a single code package.<br>-->
