# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_

_-Examine the factory design pattern and consider how it may be implemented in software.<br>
-Consider the fact that multiple design patterns may be applied alongside one another in a single code development.<br>
-Recognise that some design patterns are more likely to be used with others in a single code development.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<Br>
_-Write a Python program which applies a factory design pattern to generate objects.<br>
-Discuss the fact that multiple design patterns are able to be applied together to support a single code development.<br>
-Describe the design patterns which are more likely to be applied with one another in a single code package.<br>-->

## Reflection

I attended the last seminar this week wherein various design patterns in coding were tackled. Besides this, I finished my last requirements for the OOP module. I finally got to build my e-Portfolio website. It is simple, but I tried my best to relay my learning for each module clearly. Besides the website, since it is a requirement too, I built a separate Github branch for OOP. It has the same contents as my website. I personally enjoyed building the website more since I like working on the design side of things. I wrote a  reflective piece that gives an overview of my learning and realisations during the OOP module. My action plan presents how I achieved my learning goals, and the skills matrix shows how I assessed my overall performance this module.
