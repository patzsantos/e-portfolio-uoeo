## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability**

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP-%20Unit%201%20Initial%20Post.pdf) for the priorities assigned.

## Codio Activities

Classes and Objects: 
- [Circle](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/codio_circle.py)
- [Persons list](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/codio_persons.list.py)<br>

## Reflection 

I will admit that I have no prior exposure or grasp of Object Oriented programming. Therefore, a lot of the concepts and terms are alien to me. The collaborative discussion about factors that influence reusability was a good introduction to this module, as it gave me an overview of how that practice can lead to efficacy in producing new software, as not everything has to start from scratch. Codio activities, it seems, are becoming more complex for me.

# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

<!--_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

_-Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.<br>
-Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram._<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:<br>**_

_-Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.<br>

## Formative Activities

Continue the discussion in unit 1. Based on what we have covered in the first two units, you should [respond](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%202/OOP_%20Unit%202%20Peer%20Responses.pdf) to at least 2 of your peers’ contributions from Unit 1. <br>

## Codio Activities
- [Methods](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%202/codio_methods.time.py)
- [Functions](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%202/codio_functions.time.py)

## Reflection 
I read and responded to the initial post of my peers from the collaborative discussion 1. It was interesting to see that we ranked the factors that influence reusability differently. It is good to take note of their opinion, while simultaneously broadening my own understanding of reusability. The Codio activities introduced me to writing functions and methods in classes.

-Design UML models to represent aspects of specific software systems.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Recognise the syntax used to design UML models.<br>
-Distinguish between the UML models which are applicable at various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).<br>
-Develop UML models using open source tools.<br>_-->

## Formative Activities 

Continue the discussion in unit 1. You should now provide a [summary post](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203-%20Summary%20Post.pdf) into to the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. 

## e-Portfolio Activities

- [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20UML%20Models%20Applicable%20at%20Different%20Stages%20of%20the%20SDLC.pdf) which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to [design](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20Washing%20Machine%20State%20Diagram.pdf) a similar model for a washing machine.

## Reflection

I learned various UML models that are used for software development. I became aware of the syntax used in different diagrams. I also used Visual Paradigm Online, an open source tool, to create my Washing Machine state diagram. The first e-Portfolio activity taught me that UML models are intended for different purposes, depending on the stage they are in the Software Development Life Cycle.

# Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Experiment with further UML models, including a class diagram.<br>
-Write a Python program which implements the UML class diagram.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Prepare a class diagram which corresponds to a system which will be implemented.<br>
-Take a UML model and implement software using it._-->

## Codio Activity
- [Double day](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%204/codio_doubleday.py)

## Reflection
I took advantage of this week to get back on track with answering my Codio exercises. Learning about class diagrams was a bit overwhelming for me. But my understanding is that they detail quite well how to implement systems. This will be very helpful in developing the proposal of my driverless car. However, I have to admit that I need to do more reading and research on class diagrams. 

---

# Unit 5: More on Classes

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Consider the modularity of object oriented code and the use of abstract classes to facilitate inheritance.<br>
-Examine the different ways in which inheritance is enabled, using polymorphism, aggregation and composition <br>
-Realise the role which is played by packages and namespaces in relation to variable naming._<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Create a Python program which uses a constructor and abstract class.<br>
-Describe the concepts of polymorphism, aggregation and composition.<br>
-Name variables according to the namespace within which they exist._<br>-->

## Codio Activity
- [Inheritance](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%205/codio_inheritance.deckofcards.py)

## Reflection
I continued working on my Codio activities this week, and I focused on Inheritance. The deck of cards exercise was quite difficult for my level. Honestly, it was quite later on in the module that I fully understood what Inheritance is. This was when I was making class diagrams for my System Design Proposal in Unit 7. Class diagrams gave me a visual representation of how Inheritance works, and that is when I saw how smaller classes can be derived from bigger ones, called Superclass. 

---
# Unit 6: Abstract Methods and Interfaces

<!--_**In this unit we shall: <br>**_
_-Consider the benefits of using interfaces in Python.<br>
-Develop a Python program which uses interfaces.<br>
-Recognise the metrics which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of an object oriented program.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_
_-Describe the ways in which interfaces support Python code design.<br>
-Write a Python program which applies interfaces.<br>
-Define the metrics by which an object oriented program can be assessed._<br>-->

## Codio Activity
- [Encapsulation](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/tree/module2/oop/Unit%206/Encapsulation)- Screenshots of some of the reading questions I answered for the Encapsulation module in Codio.<br>

## Reflection
I worked on the Encapsulation activities in Codio, where I gathered that it can be used for grouping and privatise information. I learned that using an underscore makes attributes private. 

---

# Unit 7: Debugging / Error Handling, Data Structures and Data Search

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Gain an understanding of the need to debug code and the typical types of errors which can be found in a program.<br>
-Examine the ability of linters to support the development of high quality code.<br>
-Become familiar with a range of data structures which may be used to store data.<br>
-Explore the effectiveness of different search techniques to examine the stored data.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:<br>**_
_-Apply Python tools to examine the quality of code.<br>
-Implement data structures to store data.<br>
-Implement a search algorithm to explore stored data.br>_-->

## e-Portfolio Activity

[Create](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%207/datastructures.py) a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods: items(), keys(), values()

## Summative Assessment 1

[System Design of a Driverless Car](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Driverless%20Car%20Summative%20Assessment%201%20and%202/System%20Design%20Proposal/OOP%20Assignment%201_%20A%20Design%20Proposal%20of%20Software%20to%20Support%20Operation%20of%20a%20Driverless%20Car.pdf)

## Reflection

I truly enjoyed making UML models for this unit. I had to watch videos about its development process to better understand what they are used for, and what they intend to show, depending on the diagram. As a result, even though it was quite overwhelming, creating various UML models for my driverless car enlightened me as to what operations I will include in the proposal. This would not have been possible without academic reading and research about autonomous vehicles. Data structures will be useful in storing data for my driverless car, such as lists for traffic lights and queue for objects to avoid.

---

# Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Examine the operations which may be applied to sets, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.<br>
-Gain an appreciation of the linear data search technique.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Describe the scenarios in which each of the set operations will be applicable in relation to the driverless car scenario.<br>
-Implement a linear data search technique.<br>_-->

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: OO Design for IoT.**

Making reference to the article by Fortino et al. (2015), consider the strengths and weaknesses of designing a metamodel to support object-oriented design of the IoT. [Design](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/OOP%20Unit%208_%20Collaborative%20Discussion-%20OO%20Design%20for%20IoT.pdf) a smart model equivalent to that presented in Figure 6 which would instead support operation of a driverless car.

## Codio Activities

Polymorphism: 
- [Method overloading 1](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overloading.py)
- [Method overloading 2](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overloading2.py)
- [Method overriding](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%208/codio_method.overrriding.py)

## Reflection

The collaborative discussion introduced me to designing metamodels that support IoT design. After reding more on it, I have discovered it still has weaknesses, despite its numerous strengths. Though there is still room for improvement, the design activity gave me a chance to improve on my driverless car class diagram into a smart model one. The result was a more specific and clearer diagram, that incorporated hardwares used, as well as color blocking to better distinguish classes.

# Unit 9: Packaging and Testing

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>
_-Appreciate the concept of packaging a Python program.<br>
-How the PEP257 convention to document a Python program.<Br>
-Describe the range of approaches used to test code.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_
_-Appropriately package a Python code development.<br>
-Adequately and effectively document your code.<br>
-Use the tools available in Python to test the quality of code.<br>_-->

## Formative Activity

Continue the discussion in unit 8. Based on what we have covered in the first two units, you should [respond](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/OOP-%20Unit%209%20Peer%20Response.pdf) to your at least 2 of your peers’ contributions from Unit 8. 

## e-Portfolio Activities

1. [Cyclomatic complexity](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/OOP%20Unit%209-%20e-Portfolio%20Activity%203.pdf)

2. [Assert statement](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/assert.py)

## Reflection

Looking back, the e-Portfolio activities are quite simple. However, I overanalysed and spent so much time working on them. It is a good reminder to increase my focus, and improve on my coding and critical thinking skills so that I can be more efficient as I go through the module activities. In Unit 9, I learned about how to compute for cyclomatic complexity using McCabe's formula. I also embedded a simple code with assert statements, which can quickly test code. My self-assessment is that despite reading about packaging in Python, I need to actually implement them when building programs, which at this point, I have not done yet.

# Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_ <br>
_-Apply unit tests to test the functionality of Python code.<br>
-Use the pylint testing tool to automatically check acceptability of the style used to write the Python code.<br>
-Experiment with approaches to commenting inline and documenting code.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_ <br>
_-Write unit tests to ensure correct functionality of Python code.<br>
-Run pylint against a Python script to demonstrate stylistic correctness.<br>
-Document code for release to stakeholders.<br>_-->

## Formative Activity
Continue the discussion in unit 8. You should now provide a [summary post](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/OOP%20Unit%2010_%20Summary%20Post.pdf) into to the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers.

## Seminar Content Activities
1. [Commenting and documentation](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/calculation.py) - added appropriate comments and documentation in the code.<br>
2. [Unittest](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2010/calculation_test.py)- tested the operations of the previous activity (calculation.py)through unittest

## Reflection
Testing code really takes up a lot of your time. However, this is the best way to check that they are working accordingly. Without testing, we might be wasting our time writing a program if it is not executing its functions correctly. Compared to the previous module, I have a slightly better understanding of unittests. The seminar this week has been very helpful, as assert statements and unittests were covered. I could apply them when I test the code for my driverless car. I have also realised the importance of proper commenting and documentation in coding. It should be simple and clear, so that anyone can understand what it does, as well as know the intention of the developer in writing it that way.

# Unit 11: Pointers, References & Memory, and Design Patterns

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Gain an appreciation of the fact that Python does not use pointers, while other programming languages, such as C, do.<br>
-Understand that the way in which code is design can contribute a carbon footprint and consider the design and development of code to minimise this footprint.<br>
-Recognise that code may be organised in a variety of manners dependent on the way in which components will interact with one another.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>
_-Describe the overhead incurred in some programming languages other than Java as a result of their use of pointers.<br>
-Discuss the reasons why Python is a more sustainable programming language than others.<br>
-Experiment with the design of code using a variety of design patterns.<br>_-->

## Summative Assessment 2:

[System Implementation of a Driverless Car](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/tree/module2/oop/Driverless%20Car%20Summative%20Assessment%201%20and%202)

## Reflection

So far, this has been the most difficult activity and assessment for me. I really struggle with coding. When I consulted about my code, my peer and tutor found many syntax errors. I had to put in extra time and work in order improve on my code. It was a good thing that I started it quite early. Despite that, I still spent a lot of time working on this. At the end of it all though, I can say that I am happy with the System Implementation of my driverless car. After many trials and errors, I feel that I was able to follow most of my design proposal. It is definitely not an excellent program, but I know that I did my best. I learned so much working on this. When I was stuck, I am thankful that members in discuss.python.org explained to me in great detail how I can make my code function the way I wanted to.

# Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_

_-Examine the factory design pattern and consider how it may be implemented in software.<br>
-Consider the fact that multiple design patterns may be applied alongside one another in a single code development.<br>
-Recognise that some design patterns are more likely to be used with others in a single code development.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<Br>
_-Write a Python program which applies a factory design pattern to generate objects.<br>
-Discuss the fact that multiple design patterns are able to be applied together to support a single code development.<br>

[Action plan](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%2012/OOP%20Unit%2012-%20Action%20Plan.pdf)<br>

## Reflection

I attended the last seminar this week wherein various design patterns in coding were tackled. Besides this, I finished my last requirements for the OOP module. I finally got to build my e-Portfolio website. It is simple, but I tried my best to relay my learning for each module clearly. Besides the website, since it is a requirement too, I built a separate Github branch for OOP. It has the same contents as my website. I personally enjoyed building the website more since I like working on the design side of things. I wrote a reflective piece that gives an overview of my learning and realisations during the OOP module. My action plan presents how I achieved my learning goals, and the skills matrix shows how I assessed my overall performance this module.
