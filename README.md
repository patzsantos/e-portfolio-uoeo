**Create any number of independent Flode charts**

This Unit is not a teaching Unit. It's main purpose is to allow students to add and run their own `Flode` charts.

- The public GitHub repository for this unit can be found at [https://github.com/codio-content/Flode-Playground](https://github.com/codio-content/Flode-Playground).

## Creating a new Flode chart
To create a new Flode chart, please follow these steps.

1. Select the 'File' menu item at the top of this page.
1. Select 'New File' from the drop down menu.
1. In the dialog that appears, locate the 'File Name' field.
1. Enter 'newfilename.flode' in this field, where 'newfilename' is a name you choose for your file. 
1. Press 'OK' and the new chart should appear.

It is important that whatever file name you choose has the extension '.flode'. This is how Codio knows to create a Flode chart.

## Closing a Flode chart
You can close a Flode chart at any time. You don't need to save it as Flode charts are saved automatically.

## Opening an existing Flode chart
To open a Flode chart, look over to the left. You will see any flode charts listed there. 

Click on the file to open it and start editing.
