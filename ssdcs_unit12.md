# Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Review journals and articles about monoliths, microkernels and microservices.<br>
- Engage in a debate about the above.<Br>
- Explore some of the advances in secure programming.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_

- Recommend a strategy around which methodology to adopt: monolithic or microservices.<br>
- Provide evidence to support your recommendation.<Br>
- Explain how faceted data approaches work.<br>
<br>

## Collaboration
<details><summary><h3> Seminar Activity: Microservices and Microkernels Debate</h3></summary>

Read Biggs et al (2018) and Bucchiarone et al (2018) as examples of modern views and approaches to the Monolithic vs. Microservices/ Microkernel debate.

- Post your team’s stance to the forum along with justifications.
- Read all the arguments for each position.
- Choose one team response that disagrees with your team stance and post a message that refutes their argument.
- During this week’s seminar session, all students will independently vote for which argument they believe was presented most persuasively.

## Reflection

At the beginning of Unit 12, I had my API demonstration. There, I presented my coding output and how the application works. There were no big incidents or negative comments from the tutor, but it made me realise that I was not able to implement a lot of functionaities in my application. Some were especially disappointing since they were already in the design proposal, which was crafted with my team. For example, I was not able to turn the security feature off, and the application does not let its users delete their own account upon request. However, what's done is done, and this is a lesson learned. A lesson to be more thorough with applciation development, and a lesson to alot more when creating projects that are new to me. 

This is not only my last unit for this module. This is also my last module for the Computer Science postgraduate certificate in UoEO. I also attended the last seminar entitled 'Microservices and Microkernels Debate'. There is this bittersweet feeling. I am happy to finally be finishing, but at the same time, I am still thirsty to learn more about computer science. It is an understatement to say that I learned a lot of things over the course of my studies here. I know I still have a long way to go to become a better computer science professional. 

At this point, I am still unsure of which specialisation I will choose, but I greatly enjoyed cybersecurity, which I learned and implemented in this SSD module. I hope to be able to bring everything I learned from this course in the workplace, if I get a chance to land a tech-related job.
