# Unit 9: Packaging and Testing

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>
_-Appreciate the concept of packaging a Python program.<br>
-How the PEP257 convention to document a Python program.<Br>
-Describe the range of approaches used to test code.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_
_-Appropriately package a Python code development.<br>
-Adequately and effectively document your code.<br>
-Use the tools available in Python to test the quality of code.<br>_-->

## Formative Activity

Continue the discussion in unit 8. Based on what we have covered in the first two units, you should [respond](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/OOP-%20Unit%209%20Peer%20Response.pdf) to your at least 2 of your peersâ€™ contributions from Unit 8. 

## e-Portfolio Activities

1. [Cyclomatic complexity](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/OOP%20Unit%209-%20e-Portfolio%20Activity%203.pdf)

2. [Assert statement](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%209/assert.py)

## Reflection

Looking back, the e-Portfolio activities are quite simple. However, I overanalysed and spent so much time working on them. It is a good reminder to increase my focus, and improve on my coding and critical thinking skills so that I can be more efficient as I go through the module activities. In Unit 9, I learned about how to compute for cyclomatic complexity using McCabe's formula. I also embedded a simple code with assert statements, which can quickly test code. My self-assessment is that despite reading about packaging in Python, I need to actually implement them when building programs, which at this point, I have not done yet.
