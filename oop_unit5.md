# Unit 5: More on Classes

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Consider the modularity of object oriented code and the use of abstract classes to facilitate inheritance.<br>
-Examine the different ways in which inheritance is enabled, using polymorphism, aggregation and composition <br>
-Realise the role which is played by packages and namespaces in relation to variable naming._<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Create a Python program which uses a constructor and abstract class.<br>
-Describe the concepts of polymorphism, aggregation and composition.<br>
-Name variables according to the namespace within which they exist._<br>-->

## Codio Activity
- [Inheritance](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%205/codio_inheritance.deckofcards.py)

## Reflection
I continued working on my Codio activities this week, and I focused on Inheritance. The deck of cards exercise was quite difficult for my level. Honestly, it was quite later on in the module that I fully understood what Inheritance is. This was when I was making class diagrams for my System Design Proposal in Unit 7. Class diagrams gave me a visual representation of how Inheritance works, and that is when I saw how smaller classes can be derived from bigger ones, called Superclass.
