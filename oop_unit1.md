# Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm ###


_**In this unit we shall:**<br>_

_-Examine what it means for a program to be object oriented.<br>
-Explore the syntax used to define a Python class.<br>
-Investigate how to define different data types in Python.<br>_


_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**<br>_

_-Describe the major features of an object oriented program, in the sense of having abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and including polymorphism.<br>
-Define a Python class.<br>
-Define a variety of data types to variables in a Python program and adapt the access modifier applied to each.<br>_


## e-Portfolio Activities

1. Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP_%20Unit%201%20Review%20the%20article%20by%20Di%20Silvestro%20%26%20Nadir%20(2021).%20Discuss%20one%20aspect%20of%20this%20article%20which%20you%20find%20unexpected..pdf) one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.

2. [Develop](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/protected_unprotected.py) a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP-%20Unit%201%20Initial%20Post.pdf) for the priorities assigned.

# Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

_-Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.<br>
-Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram._<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:<br>**_

_-Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.<br>
-Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviours and interactions within a system._<Br>

## Formative Activities

Continue the discussion in unit 1. Based on what we have covered in the first two units, you should [respond](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%202/OOP_%20Unit%202%20Peer%20Responses.pdf) to your at least 2 of your peers’ contributions from Unit 1. <br>

# Unit 3: UML

_**In this unit we shall:**_<br>

_-Be exposed to the common syntax used by the Unified Modelling Language.<br>
-Explore the major UML models which are used throughout the object oriented analysis, design and development process.<br>
-Design UML models to represent aspects of specific software systems.<br>_

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**_<br>

_-Recognise the syntax used to design UML models.<br>
-Distinguish between the UML models which are applicable at various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).<br>
-Develop UML models using open source tools.<br>_

## Formative Activities 

Continue the discussion in unit 1. You should now provide a [summary post](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203-%20Summary%20Post.pdf) into to the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. 

## e-Portfolio Activities

- [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20UML%20Models%20Applicable%20at%20Different%20Stages%20of%20the%20SDLC.pdf) which UML models are most applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to [design](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%203/OOP%20Unit%203_%20Washing%20Machine%20State%20Diagram.pdf) a similar model for a washing machine.
