## Unit 1 An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm ###

_**In this unit we shall:**<br>_

-Examine what it means for a program to be object oriented.<br>
-Explore the syntax used to define a Python class.<br>
-Investigate how to define different data types in Python.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**<br>_

-Describe the major features of an object oriented program, in the sense of having abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and including polymorphism.<br>
-Define a Python class.<br>
-Define a variety of data types to variables in a Python program and adapt the access modifier applied to each.<br>
-This unit will give exposure to the fundamental building blocks of a Python program, upon which advanced features of the programming language will be built in later weeks.<br>


### e-Portfolio Activities

1. Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP_%20Unit%201%20Review%20the%20article%20by%20Di%20Silvestro%20%26%20Nadir%20(2021).%20Discuss%20one%20aspect%20of%20this%20article%20which%20you%20find%20unexpected..pdf) one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.

2. [Develop](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/protected_unprotected.py) a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

**Collaborative Discussion Initial Post**

Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument]( for the priorities assigned.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
