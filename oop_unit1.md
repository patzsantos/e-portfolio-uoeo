# Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm ###

<!--_**In this unit we shall:**<br>_

_-Examine what it means for a program to be object oriented.<br>
-Explore the syntax used to define a Python class.<br>
-Investigate how to define different data types in Python.<br>_


_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:**<br>_

_-Describe the major features of an object oriented program, in the sense of having abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and including polymorphism.<br>
-Define a Python class.<br>
-Define a variety of data types to variables in a Python program and adapt the access modifier applied to each.<br>_-->


## e-Portfolio Activities

1. Review the article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021). [Discuss](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP_%20Unit%201%20Review%20the%20article%20by%20Di%20Silvestro%20%26%20Nadir%20(2021).%20Discuss%20one%20aspect%20of%20this%20article%20which%20you%20find%20unexpected..pdf) one aspect of this article which you find unexpected.

2. [Develop](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/protected_unprotected.py) a Python program and apply protected and unprotected variables within it.

## Collaborative Discussion Initial Post

**Discussion Topic: Factors which Influence Reusability**

Refer to the article by Padhy et al. (2018), specifically Table 1, where the authors present a list of factors which they consider influence the reusability of a piece of object-oriented software.

In this collaborative discussion, you are required to [prioritise this list, presenting your argument](https://github.com/patzsantos/e-portfolio-uoeo/blob/module2/oop/Unit%201/OOP-%20Unit%201%20Initial%20Post.pdf) for the priorities assigned.

## Codio Activities

Classes and Objects:
