## Collaboration
<details><summary><h3>Team Activity- Debate: Microservices and Microkernels</h3></summary>

Read Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona & Ockman (1999) then read Fritzsch et al (2019).

The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “

On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.
Outside the forum, discuss your positions in your team and come up with a team stance. This should be shared in Unit 12.
