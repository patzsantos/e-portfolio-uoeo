## Collaboration
<details><summary><h3>Team Activity- Debate: Microservices and Microkernels</h3></summary>

Read Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona & Ockman (1999) then read Fritzsch et al (2019).

The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “

On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.
Outside the forum, discuss your positions in your team and come up with a team stance. This should be shared in Unit 12.

## Reflection
Unit 11 has been the toughest for me so far, since this is when I had to produce the coding output and evidence of testing assessment that takes up 40% of our total module grade. From the onset, I was dreading this assessment since I have always had difficulty with coding and creating applications. Therefore, I can only blame myself for starting this late, resulting in lacking time to research and implement the requirements outlined in the submission details. 

Still, in the end, I am happy with my output, though at present time, the grades have not been released. I did my best, and I feel that I was able to implement all minimum security freatures required: authorisation and authentication, encryption, and event monitoring. I tried working on Flask and Postman API, but that didn't work out for me. I decided to use Django, which was quite easy to navigate and code. The web page which presents the functionality of the application was to my liking as well. 

As mentioned earlier, I was running out of time. I was still working on the day of the submission. I know its a privilege to have that extra time, and I am thankful that I was able to finally encrypt the database and add event monitoring on that last day. Due to my exhaustion from coding, I had a difficult time coming up to 1,500 words for the README file, but eventually did. 

I really wished this assessment was still a group work. I was happy to still be messaging with some of my groupmates, who encouraged me and talked with me while I was working on this requirement.
