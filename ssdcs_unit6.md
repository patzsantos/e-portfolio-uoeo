# Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing
<br>

_**In this unit we shall:** <br>_

- Apply linters to support quality Python code development.<br>
- Appreciate the different contributions from linters which are described as having similar objectives, and to realise their applicability and utility in different scenarios.<br>
- Correct Python code so that it is free from error and consistent in its design.<br>

_**On completion of this unit you will be able to:** <br>_
- Be familiar with using linters to support quality Python code development.<br>
- Compare and contrast the outputs from linters to recognise their relevance and applicability in different development and testing scenarios.<br>
- Develop Python code, which is free of error, consistent in its design, and considered to be high quality according to common Python standards.<br>
<br>

## Reflection

At the start of the module, our team had our last official meeting. We only had things to smooth out about the document, and we just wanted to consult with Dr. Peoples one last time on the seminar. Since we are almost done with the paper, I was able to finish the seminar activities before the actual seminar. I am happy to be able to use more types of linters. The new ones I used this week are 'flake8' and 'mccabe'. I really wish I knew how to use these earlier, as they would have helped in detecting errors in my coding assessments during earlier modules. I noticed that flake8 is quicker than pylint, though it does not detect all errors. I was also able to see how complex my code is, in relation to last week's e-portfolio activity, by running 'mccabe'. 

During the seminar, we had really valuable input from Dr. Peoples as to how to further improve the paper, and we applied that as soon as possible. We finished the paper on the internal deadline our team set, which was Friday. That is 3 days earlier than the deadline. I am really happy with our team dynamics. Our team worked towards the same goal. I am thankful that all team members did their tasks excellently, that is why I am proud of our final output.
