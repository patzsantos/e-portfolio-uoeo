## Reflection

This week, I analysed the response of my peers to the TrueCrypt discussion forum from Unit 8. I read more about their research, which included alternative encryption tools to TrueCrypt like BitLocker, and how they should be paired with a Trusted Platform Module. Their ontology also gave me a better idea how to revise my ontology in a diagram form for the summary post next week.
