### Module 3: Secure Software Development (Computer Science)<br>
_This module introduces students to the underpinning concepts and skills of Secure Software Development. This includes a review of traditional and contemporary Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) models, focusing in particular on the areas most affected by secure coding considerations. The course will provide students with a combination of an understanding of security principles together with exposure to automated testing tools. Students will be introduced to the techniques in an engaging format, using a mixture of practical exercises, group work and individual activities._<br>
